# face-warp-animation
An animated face that can be warped by the user. The implementation uses interpolation between different facial expressions to create unique expressions and uses interpolation to animate between a neutral face and an expressive face. Users can iterate through anchor points on the face and move those anchor points to warp the verticies of the face mesh closest to that anchor.
